name: story-prompts-eval
description: Evaluate and improve a story's image prompts from the text alone — no image generation, no ComfyUI, no GCS, no vision model. Use when asked to lint/check/review/critique a story's prompts before rendering, improve prompts cheaply or "without generating images", catch prompt problems early, verify a prompt would actually produce its intended panel, or check that each prompt matches its gist and follows the story-prompts rules (shot/framing cue, one action per person, position cued only when the beat needs it, verbatim scene anchor, identity-preserve ending, no cross-panel reference words, valid {TOKEN}s). The cheap, fast counterpart to `image-eval` (which grades generated images). Reads imagegen/prompts/<type>_<id>.json; pairs with the `story-prompts` and `image-eval` skills.

# story-prompts-eval

Grade a story's **prompt text** against its **gists** and the `story-prompts`
rules, and recommend concrete edits — **before** spending a ComfyUI run on it.
Image generation is the expensive, slow step; most prompt defects (a panel whose
prompt drifts from its intended beat, a scene anchor that isn't repeated verbatim,
an unresolvable `{TOKEN}`) are visible in the
text and can be fixed for free here. This skill **reads and grades only** — it
generates nothing and edits nothing; apply the fixes via the `story-prompts` skill.

This is the text-only sibling of `image-eval`:

| Skill | Input | Question it answers | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **story-prompts-eval** (this) | the prompt + gist **text** | "Would this prompt, rendered faithfully, satisfy its gist — and does it obey the rules?" | free / instant |
| `image-eval` | the **generated images** | "Does the image the model actually produced satisfy the prompt + gist?" | a ComfyUI run + vision judging |

The **gist** (`imagegen/prompts/README.md`, the JSON `gists` array, authored by
the `story-text` skill) is the shared spec: a one-sentence statement of what each
panel must show. The pipeline is `story-text` (writes gist + dialog) →
`story-text-eval` (grades them) → `story-prompts` (writes the prompt from the
gist) → **story-prompts-eval** (this — grades prompt↔gist in text) → render →
`image-eval` (grades the pixels against the same gist). story-prompts-eval checks
the prompt against the gist's intent in text; image-eval checks the pixels against
the same intent. Run story-prompts-eval first; only generate once it's clean.

## Workflow

### 1. Run the mechanical linter

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. ~/python_env/torch-env/bin/python \
    .claude/skills/story-prompts-eval/lint_prompts.py --story 1_1     # one story
PYTHONPATH=. ~/python_env/torch-env/bin/python \
    .claude/skills/story-prompts-eval/lint_prompts.py --all           # whole catalog
```

`lint_prompts.py` decides everything that is deterministic from the text and
prints, per panel, the prompt, its gist, and any findings:

- **FAIL** (load-bearing, unambiguous) — wrong prompt/gist counts; a panel missing
  the preserve-identity pin (`{INPUT_IMAGE_IDENTITY}` or the expanded sentence),
  or whose pin trails the prompt instead of sitting **right after the protagonist
  block** (rule 6); a panel missing the **exact person-count guard** (`Exactly …
  in the frame, and no other people.`) as the **final sentence of the prompt**, or
  whose stated headcount ≠ **one protagonist + one per distinct `{TOKEN}`** named
  in the panel (rule 12); no `"person from the input image"` reference; a
  `{TOKEN}` that doesn't resolve in `character.json`; **the same character
  `{TOKEN}` used more than once in one prompt** (it expands to the full appearance
  description, so a repeat injects the whole description twice and risks a
  duplicate person — name it once, refer back by a role noun/pronoun, rule 5); an
  empty gist or a gist that still carries a `{TOKEN}`; a banned cross-panel
  reference (`the same`, `back at`, `as before`, `transform the scene`, `place the
  person into`); a **generic interaction template** that references the cast as
  `each person` / `the other person` / `both people` / `each character` / `the
  others` / `the shared object` instead of the named people + the specific prop —
  it tells the model there are unspecified extra people and it invents duplicates
  (rule 4).
- **WARN** (review) — no named camera/shot cue (medium shot, eye-level, … — the
  lever for framing, rule 3); a `{TOKEN}`
  used but not listed in `characters` (or listed but unused); a `\bagain\b` /
  `once more` that *might* be a cross-panel reference; **anchor drift** — panels
  that share a scene but whose setting-anchor wording isn't verbatim (rule 10);
  **interaction risk** — ball handoffs without one shared ball, or approach
  wording aimed only at furniture/areas instead of the target character.

Exit code is non-zero if any FAIL exists. Add `--json` for machine-readable
findings. **Resolve every FAIL** (via `story-prompts`); judge each WARN — many are
fine in context (e.g. "beginning to smile *again*" within one panel), but say why
you're keeping it.

### 2. Judge what the regex can't — prompt ↔ gist alignment (the core of this skill)

The linter cannot read meaning. Using the prompts + gists it printed, judge **each
panel** on the things only a reader can:

- **Gist alignment** — would this prompt, if the model rendered it faithfully,
  produce an image that **satisfies the gist**? Walk the gist's elements (setting,
  who is present, the key action/interaction, the narrative beat) and confirm each
  is actually instructed by the prompt. Flag every divergence **both ways**: the
  prompt asks for something the gist doesn't intend, or the gist's beat isn't in
  the prompt. Example: gist says the child *offers* a block and the friend
  *accepts*, but the prompt only says the child "holds a block" — the give/take
  beat isn't instructed, so the render won't show it. If prompt and gist disagree,
  decide which is right and recommend fixing the other (usually tighten the prompt;
  sometimes the gist was mis-stated).
- **One concrete action per person** (rule 4) — every person named (protagonist +
  each `{TOKEN}`) has a physical verb/gesture, never just placement + expression.
  A bare `stands`/`sits` + an expression (no action) is a defect; the
  model invents a pose for the idle body.
- **Physically connected interactions** (rule 4) — any play/help/handoff/
  invitation/teaching beat should read as one shared action, not isolated poses
  in the same scene. Shared props must be a single object linking hands or gaze
  across the people. Movement toward another character must name that character
  as the target, not only a bench, doorway, toy, or general area. Flag prompts
  like "child tosses a ball; friend catches the ball" unless they specify one
  ball between them, and prompts like "walks toward the bench" unless they direct
  the child toward the seated friend. The connection line must **name the exact
  people (role nouns) and the exact shared object/action** of the panel — the
  linter FAILs the generic templates (`each person`, `the other person`, `both
  people`, `the shared object`, …); confirm any rephrase still names who and
  what rather than swapping one generic phrase for another. For greetings or
  "saying hello" beats, flag front-facing rows of people waving, or vague wording
  like "all look toward one another" without a directed pose; those often render
  as everyone waving at the camera. The prompt should make the group inward-facing
  and name reciprocal gaze/body/hand direction between the protagonist and the
  classmate(s).
- **Scene-first, single-block person** (rule 1 / rule 10 "split reference") — the
  panel opens with the scene anchor (no person inside it), then introduces each
  person **once** in a contiguous position+action+expression block. A
  protagonist named near the scene and **again** later reads as two children.
- **Verbatim scene anchor across a scene** (rule 10) — panels set in the same place
  repeat the **identical** anchor string (same adjectives/landmarks/light, only the
  leading article free to differ). The linter's `anchor` WARN points at candidates;
  confirm by reading. A recurring changed-state object (a shattered vase, a tidied
  room) must be worded identically too.
- **Cast by token only** (rule 8) — supporting characters get position/action/
  expression only, never a re-described appearance.

### 3. Recommend concrete prompt fixes

For each issue, write the **specific edit** to the prompt (or gist) string, tied
to the rule it satisfies — concrete enough to paste in. Prefer fixing the prompt
to match the gist; only change the gist when the gist itself mis-states the intent.

### 4. Report back

Give a per-story verdict (`✅ ready to generate` / `⚠️ fix prompts first` /
`❌ rework`), the FAIL/WARN counts, the panels needing edits with their fixes, and
note that this is a **text-only** check — the image-side confirmation is
`image-eval` after a render. Structure the written report like:

```markdown
# Story-prompts eval — <title> (<story>)

- **Verdict:** ✅ ready to generate / ⚠️ fix prompts first / ❌ rework — one line
- **Mechanical:** <F> FAIL, <W> WARN (from lint_prompts.py)

## Panels
### Panel N
- Prompt: "<prompt>"
- Gist: "<gist>"
- Mechanical: <linter findings, or "clean">
- Gist alignment: pass | **gap** — <which gist element the prompt doesn't instruct>
- Action per person / scene-first / anchor / cast: <only the ones with an issue>
- Fix: <exact edit to the prompt string>

## Recommended prompt fixes (paste-ready)
- Panel N: <edit>
```

## Notes

- story-prompts-eval grades the **same rules** `story-prompts` writes to and the **same
  gist** `image-eval` grades the image against — so a clean lint is the
  pre-condition for generating, and `image-eval` is the post-condition.
- The natural loop: `story-text` (gist + dialog) → `story-text-eval` → `story-prompts`
  (prompt from the gist) → `story-prompts-eval` (this) → fix via `story-prompts` →
  re-lint until clean → generate (`local-batch-eval`) → `image-eval` on the images.
- The linter reuses the worker's own `{TOKEN}` composer when importable, so its
  "resolvable" verdict matches what `workflow.py` would actually render.
